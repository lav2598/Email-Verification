1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the email-verification directory.
3. Configure the email server settings and email templates according to your requirements.
4. Integrate the module with your existing user registration system or authentication flow. 

## Usage

Once installed and configured, the email verification module seamlessly integrates into your application's user registration or authentication process. Here's a basic usage guide:

1. *User Registration*: When a user registers for an account, trigger the email verification module to send a verification email to the provided email address.
2. *Verification Link*: Include a unique verification link in the email, directing the user to a designated endpoint in your application.
